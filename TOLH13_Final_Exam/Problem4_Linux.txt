We start by grepping the second line due to it being the only line containing the string "d49".

cat records.txt | grep d49
Thu Aug 1 07:53:01 GMT 2013 *OK* user:steven.white door:d49

Then we cut the string with the delimiter ':', this will give us the following array
[Thu Aug 1 07 , 53 , 01 GMT 2013 *OK* user , steven.white door , d49]
and then we retrieve the 2nd and the 4th element (not starting from 0, because 0 is the whole string) and we concatenate them with the delimiter

cat records.txt | grep d49 | cut -d’:’ -f 2,4
53:steven.white door

then we use cut with the delimiter space which will give us the following array
[53:steven.white , door]
and we retrieve the first element and get

cat records.txt | grep d49 | cut -d’:’ -f 2,4 | cut -d’ ’ -f 1
53:steven.white
